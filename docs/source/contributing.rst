Contributing to PGMax
=====================

PGMax is an open-source library, and as such, we very much value
contributions from the community!

Contributing code using pull requests
-------------------------------------

We welcome pull requests, in particular for documentation upgrades,
additional examples, or those issues marked with `good first
issue <https://github.com/vicariousinc/PGMax/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22>`__
or
`contributions-welcome <https://github.com/vicariousinc/PGMax/labels/contributions-welcome>`__.

For other proposals, we ask that you first open a GitHub
`Issue <https://github.com/vicariousinc/PGMax/issues/new/choose>`__  to seek
feedback on your planned contribution.

We do all of our development using git, so basic knowledge is assumed.

Follow these steps to contribute code:

1. Follow the `Developer Installation
   Instructions <installation.html#developer>`__ to install a fork of PGMax
   locally on a new branch.
2. Develop and implement your changes with your favorite code editor (we
   recommend `VS Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`__)
3. Ensure your code still passes formatting checks and unit tests by
   running ``pre-commit run --all-files`` (for formatting checks) and
   ``pytest`` (for unit tests) from within your poetry environment from
   the root of the repository.
4. Submit a pull request (PR) from the particular branch you've changed
   on your fork of PGMax.
