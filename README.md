<h1 align="center">
Following the acquisition of <a href="https://intrinsic.ai/blog/posts/mission-momentum">Vicarious by Alphabet</a> in 2022, we are excited to share that PGMax has moved to DeepMind! This repository is no longer being maintained, and all future developments will happen in the
<a href="https://github.com/deepmind/PGMax">new PGMax repository under DeepMind</a>.
<br>
<br>
We look forward to the new exciting research possibilities from PGMax's integration within DeepMind's rapidly growing JAX ecosystem.
